Interative Resume
==================

This is an attempt to make this project my own, by using the theme I created in the initial project. Rather than a single page, I've decided to span the data across multiple pages, for a potentially better user experience. The bio data is repeated from page to page, while the projects, work and education are more focused on single pages.

*"I hereby confirm that this submission is my work. I have cited above the origins of any parts of the submission that were taken from Websites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories, etc. By including this in my email, I understand that I will be expected to explain my work in a video call with a Udacity coach before I can receive my verified certificate."*
